# Frontend Changes - Bestsellers Removal & Offers Carousel

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Bestsellers Section
- **Deleted**: `frontend/src/components/BestSeller.jsx` component
- **Updated**: `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx` - removed BestSeller import and usage
- **Result**: Bestsellers section no longer appears on the frontend UI

### 2. Added New Offers Carousel
- **Created**: `frontend/src/components/OffersCarousel.jsx` - new carousel component
- **Features**:
  - Rotating carousel with 3 slides
  - Summer Offers (Up to 70% Off)
  - Billion Day Offers (Mega Sale Event)
  - Flash Sale (24 Hours Only)
  - Auto-rotation every 5 seconds
  - Navigation arrows and dots
  - Responsive design

### 3. Updated Hero Section
- **Modified**: `frontend/src/components/Hero.jsx` - updated text content
- **Changes**:
  - "OUR BESTSELLERS" → "SUMMER OFFERS"
  - "Latest Arrivals" → "BILLION DAY OFFERS"

### 4. Home Page Updates
- **Updated**: `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`
- **Changes**:

  - Removed BestSeller component

## Carousel Images

The carousel currently uses placeholder images from Unsplash:
- **Summer Offers**: Fashion/summer themed image
- **Billion Day Offers**: Shopping/sale themed image  
- **Flash Sale**: Fashion/retail themed image

## Customization

To use your own images:
1. Replace the `image` URLs in `OffersCarousel.jsx`
2. Update the offer titles, subtitles, and descriptions as needed
3. Adjust the auto-rotation timing (currently 5 seconds)

## Notes

- The `bestseller` property is still maintained in the admin panel for product management
- Product sorting still prioritizes bestsellers first in the backend
- Only the frontend display of bestsellers has been removed
- The new carousel provides a more dynamic and engaging user experience
